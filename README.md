# Control Algorithms

This project contains implementations of different control algorithms.

## Files Description

- **pid.py**: Implements a PID controller.
- **energy.py**: Implements an energy-based control algorithm that minimizes the energy difference between actual and desired states.
- **rso.py**: Implements a Random Search Optimization.
- **mppi.py**: Implements the Model Predictive Path Integral controller for trajectory optimization.
